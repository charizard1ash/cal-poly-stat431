# Overview

This repository runs through the exercises from publicly available advanced statistics course from [STAT-431](https://cal-poly-advanced-r.github.io/STAT-431/).

Each script however will be written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) as opposed to [R](https://www.r-project.org/), as a means of upskilling myself in the new and upcoming programming language! :)
